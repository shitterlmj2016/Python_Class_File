    "# Working with streaming data: Using the Twitter API to capture tweets\n",
    "If you've done any data science or data analysis work, you've probably read in a csv file or connected to a database and queried rows. A typical data analysis workflow involves retrieving stored data, loading it into an analysis tool, and then exploring it. This works well when you're dealing with historical data such as analyzing what products a customer at your online store is most likely to purchase, or whether people's diets changed in response to advertising. But what if you want to predict stock prices in real-time? Or figure out what people are watching on television right now?\n",
    "\n",
    "As more data is generated, it's becoming increasingly important to be able to work with real-time data. Real-time, or streaming, data is generated continuously, and in the case of the stock market, there can be millions of rows generated every hour. Due to size and time constraints, there often isn't a neat dataset that you can analyze â€” you'll need to either store the data to analyze later, or analyze it in real time, as you get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to work with streaming data is a critical skill for any aspiring data scientist. In this post, we'll talk about strategies for working with streaming data, and walk through an example where we stream and store data from Twitter.\n",

    "For those of you unfamiliar with Twitter, it's a social network where people post short, 140-character, status messages called tweets. Because tweets are sent out continuously, Twitter is a great way to figure out how people feel about current events. In this post, we'll create a tool that enables us to find out how people feel about Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, both of whom are US Presidential candidates. To do this, we'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Stream tweets from the Twitter API.\n",
    "* Filter out the tweets that aren't relevant.\n",
    "* Process the tweets to figure out what emotions they express about each candidate.\n",
    "* Store the tweets for additional analysis.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Create a persistent connection to the Twitter API, and read each connection incrementally.\n",
    "* Process tweets quickly, and don't let your program get backed up.\n",
    "* Handle errors and other issues properly.\n",

    "There are a variety of clients for the Twitter Streaming API across all major programming languages. For Python, there are quite a few, which you can find [here](https://dev.twitter.com/resources/twitter-libraries). The most popular is [tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy), which allows you to connect to the streaming API and handle errors properly.\n",

    "You may notice the url parameter above. We can gather all the tweets generated on Twitter by hitting the firehose.json API endpoint. Gathering all tweets at once would overwhelm our computer, though, since it's hundreds of thousands of tweets a minute. This access is also restricted, and not everyone can access the firehose data. We'll instead have to access the filter.json API endpoint. This API endpoint takes in a list of strings, then searches for those strings in tweets. Instead of all tweets, you get a filtered subset, which makes them much easier for your local machine to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also notice the auth keyword argument above. The Twitter Streaming API requires authentication. You'll need to create a developer account, then pass your credentials into tweepy so it can pass them to Twitter. We'll walk through how to do this in a later section."

A -1 means that the tweet is very negative a 0 is neutral, and a 1 means that the tweet is very positive. Sentiment analysis tools typically generate this score by seeing if words known to indicate negative and positive sentiment occur in a string. For example, if the word hate occurs in a string, it is more likely to be negative. Because sentiment analysis is essentially string matching, it is extremely quick to work, which is important for us, since the longer we take to process, the more likely that we'll fall behind on processing tweets and be disconnected.\n",

    "## Analyzing the tweets\n",
    "If we want to analyze the tweets after storing them, we'll need to write additional code to query the database. We can also do this using the datasets package.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the below code would query all of the tweets from our database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "db = dataset.connect(\"sqlite:///tweets.db\")\n",
    "\n",
    "result = db[\"tweets\"].all()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a set of results, we can either process them, or store them to a csv file, like in this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dataset.freeze(result, format='csv', filename=settings.CSV_NAME)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the code for a program to dump all the existing tweets to a csv file [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/twitter-scrape/blob/master/dump.py). You can run this program from the command line with \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python dump.py\n",
    "```"
